After earning a mention très bien in the French Baccalauréat, I spent a year immersed in English training in Scotland before completing a Licence en Économie et Gestion with a focus on economics. For over six years, I’ve been actively investing and trading in financial markets—particularly FOREX, commodities like XAUUSD, indices such as the DXY, and major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, ADA, and XRP, occasionally exploring high-risk, low-cap assets with disciplined money management. My trading strategy is rooted in macroeconomic analysis, leveraging news, empirical data, and probabilistic models to anticipate market movements.

Alongside finance, I’ve explored the intersection of tech and economics through a blockchain NFT collection project and validated programming bootcamps in Python, Bash, HTML/CSS, and data science. Professionally, I’ve gained two years of experience as a junior data annotator for an Irish firm, now evolving toward a senior role in qualitative data analysis. Currently, I’m channeling all this into a personal project that analyzes public financial data from listed companies—transforming raw information into actionable economic insights.
