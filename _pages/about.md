### Welcome! 

### _Why are things the way they are ?_ 
Trying to understand the world and my environment has always been something that stimulates me, no matter what the subject, it's my insatiable curiosity that drives me to gain a deeper understanding of what is around me.

That's why, after completing my _French Baccalauréat_ with a _mention très bien_, I undertook a one-year training programme in English in Edinburgh (Scotland) to further develop my linguistic skills, as language is the system that allows us to pass on our knowledge through time. I then obtained a _Bachelor of Science_ in _Economics_ from _Panthéon-Sorbonne University, Paris 1_; to better understand what has shaped the organisation of our civilisation and the world it has created around us with its various coexisting nuances/branches.

The scientific approach of using acquired past data to try to predict future behaviour is one of my _"how to's"_, so as a personal training in my spare time, I've been applying the knowledge I've gained in probability and statistics, econometrics and related fields to a smaller public but impactful branch of our world, the financial markets, with a focus on FOREX, commodities such as XAUUSD, indices such as the DXY or UVXY, and major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, ADA and XRP.

In a very succinct way, the trading strategy I use to navigate the markets is based on _meticulous micro- and macroeconomic analysis_ that draws from a variety of data sources, including news updates, open-source research data, behavioral economic empirical evidence, and the results of probabilistic models, in an effort to anticipate market movements as accurately as my knowledge allows. 
  I do this by applying various economic theories and testing hypotheses that mimic what might coexist in the markets. 
  In certain cases, when implementing a more restricted money management strategy in conjunction with a market trend analysis approach, I also explore higher risk, lower capitalisation assets.

In addition to my economics background, I've also worked on various other projects including the production of a blockchain NFT collection generation, intrigued by the potential of the underlying technology. 

As the amount of data that can be processed to discover valuable and more accurate insights if done well, using computers, scales better than with paper alone, I have recently followed and validated certified programming bootcamps in Python and Bash for relational database management, data analysis and scientific computing.

Professionally, I have two years' experience in verifying the accuracy of AI output quality data analysis. As a freelancer for an Irish unicorn company called Peroptyx, I started at a junior level and then progressed to a senior position.
 
Currently, for the past month, I have been working on a personal project analysing public financial data from a listed company (Nvidia). The aim of the project is to transform the mined information into actionable economic insights by leveraging everything I have learned so far.
